# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture

## Required Homework/Task - Building a Micro-Blogging Platform Called Cruddur

First, I started with understanding the Architecture of the Crudder App, its requirements, features, target audience, cost and the general overview of how the app looks like. Then, I proceeded to do the following;

### Napkin design of the cruddur app

I designed on a napkin a conceptual diagram of the cruddur micro blogging app

### Recreating a Logical Architectural Diagram in Lucidchart

I also worked on recreating the Logical Diagram which includes the actual AWS services to be used; 'See image' below;

The next step I took was setting up my cloud environment by doing the following;

### Generate AWS Credentials for the Admin user I created

I created an generated AWS credentials for IAM admin user and also assigned admin access as shown below;

### Installed AWS CLI

 I installed the AWS CLI via the gitpod environment and confirmed it using the 'aws sts get-caller-identity' command as shown below;

 ### Create an Admin User
 
 I created an Admin User, added the user to a group, assigned permission, enabled multifactor authentication and also granted user administrative access as shown below;

### Create a Budget 

I created a zero budget for $1 because I cannot afford any kind of spend. I did not create a second budget because I was concerned of budget spending going over the two budget free limit.

### Create a Billing Alarm

I also setup a billing alarm using the Advanced option (credit) incase I get some credits, to alert me when I exceed my actual spend through email notification.

### I watched Chirag's week 0 spend considerations

I learnt how to track and monitor spend and how to utilize the free tier. I also learnt how to manage billing alert.

### Homework Challenges
'
I could not Launch the cloud shell because it was bringing up an error message so I sent a mail to the AWS support team. I'm still waiting for their response.
