## Required Homework/Task

First, I started with understanding the Architecture of the Crudder App and the overview of how it looks like. Then, I proceeded to do the following;

### Recreating a Logical Architectural Diagram in Lucidchart

I also worked on recreating the Logical Diagram which includes the actual AWS services to be used; 'See image' below;

The next step I took was setting up my cloud environment by doing the following;

### Installed AWS CLI

 I installed the AWS CLI via the gitpod environment and confirmed it using the 'aws sts get-caller-identity' command as shown below;

 ### Create an Admin User
 
 I created an Admin User, added the user to a group, assigned permission, enabled multifactor authentication and also granted user administrative access as shown below;

### Create a Budget 

I created a zero budget for $1 because I cannot afford any kind of spend. I did not create a second budget because I was concerned of budget spending going over the two budget free limit.

### Create a Billing Alarm

I also setup a billing alarm using the Advanced option (credit) incase I get some credits, to alert me when I exceed my actual spend through email notification.
